Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    4.01 sec. (3531.87 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =   10.79 sec. (11475.82 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    1.19 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =   14.80 sec. (15007.69 ticks)
