  Real time             =    2.78 sec. (2477.74 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    5.31 sec. (4961.81 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.23 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    8.09 sec. (7439.56 ticks)
Solution status: 102
Objective value: 6219.820690
