Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    9.49 sec. (10007.81 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    9.49 sec. (10007.81 ticks)
Solution status: 131
Objective value: 576.994130
