Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.60 sec. (442.00 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.70 sec. (559.61 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.04 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    1.30 sec. (1001.62 ticks)
