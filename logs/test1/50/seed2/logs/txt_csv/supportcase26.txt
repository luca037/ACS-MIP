Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.08 sec. (65.05 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.97 sec. (935.36 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.06 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    1.05 sec. (1000.41 ticks)
