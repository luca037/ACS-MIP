Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.07 sec. (70.06 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0.07 sec. (70.06 ticks)
Solution status: 101
Objective value: 103333.874073
